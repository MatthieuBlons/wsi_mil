# Package for WSI classification

This package contains all the necessary objects for building the WSI classification pipeline.
tile_wsi implements the tiling and encoding of the WSI (as well as the samplers that allows sampling tiles inside WSI w.r.t particular distributions).
deepmil implements the multiple instance learning algorithms, to train WSI classifiers.
visualizer implements the model introspection tool.
